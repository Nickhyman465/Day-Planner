# Day-Planner

# User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

# Process
in making the day planner, I knew there would be several interations of the same objects for the input lines. Becasue of that, I knew a function to dynamically create the input fields along side the times would be code and time saving. Implimenting the local storage save is a bit trickier becasue of this dynamic iteration.
